          Problem 3: The framework that I went with was React. This was a very familiar framework that I have used, as I've done several projects with it. As long as you have the latest version of Node.js, you can easily install it through the Node Package Manager(npm). 
          Through the VSCode terminal, all you have to do is type 'npx create-react-app [app-name]'. I didn't actually build this page, this was already done through the basic react project. I've had no difficulties because all I did was edit the default page in the source folder.
        </p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
